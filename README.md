# **University Progress Tracker**

## *Background:*
This application is built for Canadian high school students looking to get into a
Canadian university. Information from the top 15 Canadian universities will be present. The application is formed with 
the goal of indicating the average of a specific university program and informing the user what future action is needed
to obtain this average and be competitive. This project is of interest to me because in high school,
there was a lack of information regarding universities and their admission averages. 
The information was not consolidated into an easy-to-access format and senior students 
had to spend a significant amount of time to research the university of interest. Furthermore,
there are many universities that I did not know of when I was in high school. I hope this application
benefits future prospective university students with their university application. Good luck! 

## *Function:*
This application will perform multiple functions. Firstly, this application will allow the user to calculate
their overall across grade across multiple courses. In addition, the user will be able to input assignments for each
course and receive the overall grade for the specified course. Ideally, the application will allow for submission
of a pdf syllabus that will organize the syllabus into appropriate sections their grading. The user will be 
able to add an arbitrary number of classes, submit arbitrary number of syllabuses, arbitrary number of completed work, 
etc. Secondly, the application will allow the user to select various Canadian universities of interest as well as their 
general programs. Lastly, the application will determine whether the user is competitive for the specified program at a
chosen university based on the latest information (currently 2022).
