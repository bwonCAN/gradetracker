# **University Progress Tracker**

## *Background:*
This application is built for Canadian high school students looking to get into a
Canadian university. Information from the top 15 Canadian universities will be present. The application is formed with 
the goal of indicating the average of a specific university program and informing the user what future action is needed
to obtain this average and be competitive. This project is of interest to me because in high school,
there was a lack of information regarding universities and their admission averages. 
The information was not consolidated into an easy-to-access format and senior students 
had to spend a significant amount of time to research the university of interest. Furthermore,
there are many universities that I did not know of when I was in high school. I hope this application
benefits future prospective university students with their university application. Good luck! 

## *Function:*
This application will perform multiple functions. Firstly, this application will allow you to calculate
what grade on exams you need to achieve a certain grade. Ideally, the application will allow for submission
of a pdf syllabus that will organize the syllabus into appropriate sections their grading. The user will be 
able to add an arbitrary number of classes, submit arbitrary number of syllabuses, etc. Secondly, the application
will allow the user to select various Canadian universities of interest as well as their general programs. Thirdly, 
the application will determine how far the user's grade is from the average of the specified program. Lastly, the
application will determine what future grade is needed to obtain the university program average to have a competitive 
GPA.
